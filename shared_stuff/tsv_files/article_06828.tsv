B-Legend! Battle B-Daman Fire Spirits!	TV	51	2005-01-10 00:00:00	2005-12-26 00:00:00	6.37	2262	6831	7327	4486	It is not uncommon to wish upon shooting stars. But for B-DaPlayers all around the world, what they seek is not for their wishes to be granted. Gazing upon what many would assume are just rocks shrunk to the size of a pebble by atmospheric entry and fallen to the earth, the fated ones see instead what are known as Strike Shotsâ€”powerful marbles originating from the vast and mystical outer space.
