Hengen Taima Yakou Karura Mau! Sendai Kokeshi Enka	OVA	6	1990-09-14 00:00:00	1991-03-08 00:00:00	6.2	125	7682	11712	800	Shoko and Maiko Ougi are apparently two ordinary schoolgirls in pursuit of graduating and having fun. Shii-chan is the more serious while Mai-chan is more fun-loving. In reality, the two sisters are powerful exorcists from the Karura temple. Each wields half the power... Shii-chan can "see" the spirits, and Mai-chan can banish them. This is a spooky series with heavy emphasis on traditionally Japanese occult themes. 	['Hengen Taima Yakou Karura Mau!
