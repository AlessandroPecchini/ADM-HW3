The ruler's two sons turned against each other, unleashing the powers of their Legendary familiars—Reshiram and Zekrom—and disturbing the Dragon Force that supplied the kingdom with energy. With the help of the Mythical Pokémon Victini, balance was restored and the Dragon Force was bound by the Sword of the Vale. Should the Sword be moved, devastation will loom again.
