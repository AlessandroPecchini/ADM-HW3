Morimori Shima no Mogu to Perol (Mogu&Perol)	ONA	1	2018-01-19 00:00:00	None	None	None	12160	15732	220	Mogu is always making tasty dishes but Perol is taking far more than his share. One day Moog is looking to collect some berries (to make into a cake) but Perol eats some off the bush raw. They taste sour and Perol thinks Moog tricked him and claims they aren't friends anymore. Perol stops visiting but he becomes quite zombie-like and Moog misses his company too.	None	[]	[]	[['Gouda, Tsuneo', ['Director']]]
