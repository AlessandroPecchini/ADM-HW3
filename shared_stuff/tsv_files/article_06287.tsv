Anime Koukyoushi: Jungle Taitei	OVA	1	1991-04-01 00:00:00	None	6.47	279	6291	11221	967	Actually, that 1991 date is misleading. The Symphonic Poem originated with the music Isao Tomita wrote for Jungle Emperor in 1965. He re-worked his music into a long form which tells a story by itself. (This form of music was termed "symphonic poem" or "tone poem" by composers in the late Romantic era.) So music that was written originally to enhance visual story telling became the story teller.
