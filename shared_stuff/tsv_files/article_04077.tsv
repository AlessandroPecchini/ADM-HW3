Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko (By the Grace of the Gods)	TV	12	2020-10-04 00:00:00	2020-12-20 00:00:00	6.93	62481	4079	1368	126046	Deep in the forest, far from any human contact, there lives a child named Ryouma Takebayashi. He engages in the rather strange hobby of keeping various types of slimes as pets. Furthermore, despite his young age, he has a sturdy physique and good compatibility for magic. All of this is because, having endured much hardship in his previous life, three gods grace Ryouma with a second chance to pursue one goal: savor the wonders of life.
