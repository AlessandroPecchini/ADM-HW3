Commercial War	Movie	1	1971-01-01 00:00:00	None	4.81	230	11658	13123	470	In a mixture of cut-out and hand-drawn animation techniques, Tanaami jumbles together symbols of American consumer culture –such as Coca Cola, Superman, Space Age astronauts and hamburgers– with occasional Japanese iconography, such as the squat toilet. The frenetic pace of the animation, the catchphrases and songs on the soundtrack as well as the hand-drawn CRT television monitor that occasionally frames the images makes reference to television commercials.
