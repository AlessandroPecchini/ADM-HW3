All of its members are boys suffering from various types of chuunibyouâ€”Yamato Noda is a righteous hero, using his athletic abilities to perform noble deeds and protect others; Kazuhiro Nakamura claims to be the reincarnation of "Touga Ryushouin," the result of the forbidden union between a demon and an angel; Tomoki Takashima is a pretty-boy otaku whose one true love is the 2D anime girl Sora; and Rei Tsukumo plays the role of a schemer, covertly pulling the strings.
