A.D. Police (TV) (A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve)	TV	12	1999-04-08 00:00:00	1999-07-01 00:00:00	5.97	3507	8777	5268	10187	Set a few years before Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040, A.D. Police chronicles the tales of Mega-Tokyo's special police division designed to control rogue Boomers in the city. A.D. Police Officer Kenji Sasaki faces a major dilemma: he loses another partner to a rabid boomer. A day after he's sent off-duty, he receives a new partner in the form of German cop Hans Kleif. Funny thing is that Kenji sucker-punched Hans at a bar the night before. Not only does Kenji face the everyday task of controlling Boomers, he has to learn to adjust with his new partner.Â 	['Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040', 'AD Police', 'Parasite Dolls']	['Sasaki, Kenji', 'Kleif, Hans', 'Miyano, Kyouko', 'Wilson, Nancy']	['Chiba, Susumu', 'Yamazaki, Takumi', 'Kawasumi, Ayako', 'Nozawa, Yukari']	[['Nagai, Masaru', ['Producer']], ['Ueda, Hidehito', ['Director', ' Episode Director', ' Storyboard']], ['Fujimoto, Jirou', ['Episode Director']], ['Nakanishi, Nobuaki', ['Episode Director']]]
