Pokemon Fushigi no Dungeon: Sora no Tankentai - Toki to Yami wo Meguru Saigo no Bouken	Special	1	2009-04-12 00:00:00	None	6.68	4251	5209	5439	9397	In a world where Pokémon live and communicate with each other, there are mythical treasures known as the Time Gears that regulate the flow of time in their respective areas. If one is removed from its resting place, time will freeze in that area, so even evil Pokémon do not dare to steal them. But recently, anomalies in time have been appearing throughout the land, causing the appearance of Mystery Dungeons and violent Pokémon. Pokémon exploration teams have been formed to explore these Mystery Dungeons, arrest the violent Pokémon, and help maintain the peace.
