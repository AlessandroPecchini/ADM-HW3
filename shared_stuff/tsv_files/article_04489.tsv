Crayon Shin-chan Movie 28: Gekitotsu! Rakuga Kingdom to Hobo Yonin no Yuusha	Movie	1	2020-09-11 00:00:00	None	6.83	241	4491	10888	1143	Due to the advent of modern technology, kids have abandoned their crayons and paper for electronic tablets, causing the imaginative energy emitted from children's doodles to reach an all-time low. Consequently, the Rakuga Kingdom in the sky, powered by such energy, is now at risk of collapsing onto the cities below. For any hope to avoid such a catastrophe, the kingdom's princess hastily seeks out a hero from Earth capable of wielding the "Miracle Crayon."
