Nichijou: Nichijou no 0-wa (My Ordinary Life Episode 0)	OVA	1	2011-03-12 00:00:00	None	7.4	39642	1975	1968	74455	While the title suggests a story of simple, everyday school life, the contents are more the opposite. The setting is a strange school where you may see the principal wrestle a deer or a robot's arm hide a rollcake. However there are still normal stories, like making a card castle or taking a test you didn't study for.
