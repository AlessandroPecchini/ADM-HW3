Through her spying, she learns that he gets along well with girls at school, which results in an even bigger misunderstanding, as Miya wrongfully assumes he likes men since he doesn't have a girlfriend. However, after she herself rejects a boy, Miya starts questioning how she views Junichi as she is reminded of Junichi's similar experience from two years earlier.
