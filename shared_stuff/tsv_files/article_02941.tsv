Hyperventilation	ONA	6	2017-10-11 00:00:00	None	7.19	7202	2944	4410	16541	Lee Myeongyi has lived his whole life with pneumothoraxâ€”a collapsed lung. He despises the attention he draws at school with his bouts of loud hyperventilating, extended coughing fits, and exemption from physical education as well as military service. Whether suffering through the curiosity or ire of his classmates, Myeongyi is left feeling like a complete outcast. However, the class president Han Seonho often shows Myeongyi kindness and understanding. With his friendly gestures and handsome looks, he becomes Myeongyi's first crush.
