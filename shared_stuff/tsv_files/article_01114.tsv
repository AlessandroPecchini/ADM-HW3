Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid (The Duke of Death and His Maid)	TV	12	2021-07-04 00:00:00	2021-09-19 00:00:00	7.68	41388	1115	1226	142912	As the elegant, frail flower petals wither away into lifeless ashes, the young duke is tragically reminded of the despicable power forced upon him—the ability to kill anything he touches. Scorned by his family, he is sent away to live in near isolation. Fortunately, he is not entirely alone, as the manor's staff—his dutiful butler Rob and the flirtatious maid Alice—keep him company and make his life less miserable.
