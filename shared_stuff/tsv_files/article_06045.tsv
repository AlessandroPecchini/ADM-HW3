Half a century later, even though most have it easy, Robby Yaji and Hacchi Kita cannot seem to catch a break in this advanced society. Robby—a man perpetually struck by misfortune—owes large sums of money to debt collectors due to his poor investments in shady get-rich-quick schemes, and Hacchi finds it difficult to get over the boredom of his mundane life.
