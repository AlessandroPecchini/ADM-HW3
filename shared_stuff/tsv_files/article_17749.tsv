Aikagi The Animation	OVA	1	2019-04-26 00:00:00	None	7.14	4157	None	5488	9275	It was the last winter of his school life and with entrance exams and graduation edging closer, Nozomu didn't know what to do. He was told to become independent, but he couldn't find a suitable place to live by himself. His childhood friend Shiori couldn't stand watching him in his current state and suggested that he live with her. While he thought that it wouldn't really make him independent, his parents readily agreed to the idea. Before he knew it, they were living together under the same roof.
