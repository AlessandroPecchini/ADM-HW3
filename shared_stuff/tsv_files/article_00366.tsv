Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na! (Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!)	TV	12	2020-01-06 00:00:00	2020-03-23 00:00:00	8.15	101651	366	666	266907	Midori Asakusa sees the world a bit differently. Always having her nose in a sketchbook, Asakusa draws detailed landscapes and backgrounds of both the world around her and the one within her boundless imagination. Even the simple act of doodling on a wall evolves into an emergency repair on the outer hull of her spaceship. She is only brought back to reality by her best friend Sayaka Kanamori. The pair are stark opposites, with Asakusa's childlike wonder contrasted by Kanamori's calculated approach to life.
