Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2 (Teasing Master Takagi-san)	TV	12	2019-07-07 00:00:00	2019-09-22 00:00:00	8.1	121443	428	761	237880	Even after spending a considerable amount of time with Takagi, Nishikata is still struggling to find a perfect plan to defeat the expert teaser. A battle of wits, a contest of physical prowess, a test of courageâ€”any strategy he employs to expose her weaknesses is to no avail. On the contrary, Nishikata's pitiful attempts only reveal more of his own flaws, which Takagi takes advantage of to become increasingly daring in her teasing attempts. To make things worse for Nishikata, rumors about him and Takagi may have spread in class due to the frequent interactions between them.
