Yat-chan to Shinnyuusei	OVA	1	1975-01-01 00:00:00	None	None	None	14441	17780	104	Yat-chan is still hanging around as a ghost but has now gained supernatural powers to teach people traffic rules through a laser beam out of his finger, though people still cannot see nor hear him. In an odd parallel Yat-chan follows a boy named Ken-chan who looks a lot like him, who acts a lot like him (irresponsibly near traffic) when he was alive, and who also has a childhood friend and classmate named Miko (unrelated to Yat-chan's Miko from the first OVA).
