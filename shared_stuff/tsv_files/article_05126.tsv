Puka Puka Juju	Movie	1	2012-03-19 00:00:00	None	6.69	2607	5130	6966	5052	Mika dreams of the day when she can visit the beach with her father. Already overburdened by his day-to-day responsibilities, it seems like her father gets called in to do last-minute work every weekend. Even if he somehow manages a break, his crippling fear of the ocean would prevent him from truly enjoying the beach with his daughter.
