Masters, through the use of the command seals they are given when they enter the war, command Heroic Spirits known as Servants to fight for them in battle.

With her Servant, Archer, she hopes to obtain the ultimate prizeâ€”the Holy Grail, a magical artifact capable of granting its wielder any wish.
