Good Morning Althea	OVA	1	1987-12-16 00:00:00	None	5.5	647	10376	9949	1646	The story revolves around Nikolai, apparently a part-cyborg; Galory, a young boy who apparently is part human/part Crest person, and Althea, who is entirely a Crest person. Seems the Earth and the Crest people were at war for 300 years so there's still a lot of bad feelings present.
