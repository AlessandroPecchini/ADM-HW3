Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear	TV	12	2020-10-07 00:00:00	2020-12-23 00:00:00	7.19	46470	2948	1628	101585	After fanatically playing the VRMMO World Fantasy Online for almost a year, the shut-in yet relatively affluent fifteen-year-old Yuna receives a bear costume from the game's administrators. The outfit, while somewhat embarrassing to wear, turns out to have overpowered stats and effects that make her character significantly more powerful. After accepting the bear equipment, she finds herself transported to another in-game world that prevents her from returning to reality.
