Ongaku Shoujo	Movie	1	2015-03-22 00:00:00	None	6.22	5237	7602	4972	11823	On her way to her first day of high school, Eri Kumagai is captivated by a girl's singing. Her song is beautiful but ends abruptly when the girl steps on a cat's tail and disrupts the moment. Eri pushes this out of her mind until that same girl rushes into her class late, cat in hand, and claims that the name on the attendance list—Chiharu Yuzuka—is her "false name" and she is actually called Haru Chitose.
