Wo Shi Jiang Xiaobai 2nd Season (I'm Joybo 2nd Season)	ONA	12	2018-11-09 00:00:00	2019-01-25 00:00:00	6.65	121	5340	9879	1701	After coming to terms with their past, Jiang Xiaobai and Tong Li are still together as editor and authorâ€”and now, as lovers too. But not everything is smooth-sailing for the new couple. Tong Li's most recent work is being panned by readers and critics, and Wen Zheng Magazine's recent decline in sales means that her serialization is in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Jiang Xiaobai, fondly remembering making music with his friends in high school, steps in as the backup bassist for a local band struggling to make their break.
