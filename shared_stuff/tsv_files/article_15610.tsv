Forza! Hidemaru	TV	26	2002-04-06 00:00:00	2002-09-28 00:00:00	None	None	15617	14042	345	A soccer anime with a cast of wacky animals in sports getup seems far out of its time in the early 21st century, but it was the year of the World Cup in Japan and South Korea, and the very young audience sees these tropes with fresh eyes. Hidemaru is a feisty fox; his friends include bunnies, dogs, horses, and a couple of hefty hippo girls.
