Kitsune to Budou	OVA	1	1998-01-01 00:00:00	None	None	None	16784	16131	194	An educational film about planning for the future. The story focuses on a fox pup that wants to eat all the grape off a new plant. His mother tells him not to and he didn't understand why. When he grows up he goes back to the area where the small grape plant was to find that it's now a big sturdy vine with lots of fruit. He thanks his mother in heaven for showing him his haste to eat from the plant when it was small would have killed the plant, and thus not have grown large with bountiful fruit in the future.
