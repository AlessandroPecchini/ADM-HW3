Yanoya	Music	1	2011-05-15 00:00:00	None	None	None	14426	16355	186	In 2011, Japanese musician Akiko Yano collaborated with students at Tokyo University of the Arts for a school festival. The origin of the project name "Yanoya" comes from the desire to have a festival-like character. Some of the works included artwork, a game demo, musical performance, and stage performance. This entry covers ShiShi Yamazaki's contribution to the event, which is believed to be the only work that was animated.	None	[]	[]	[['Yamazaki, ShiShi', ['Director']]]
