Innocence (Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence)	Movie	1	2004-03-06 00:00:00	None	7.81	78285	846	1233	142121	With Major Motoko Kusanagi missing, Section 9's Batou is assigned to investigate a string of gruesome murdersâ€”seemingly at the hands of faulty gynoids, or sex robots. But when a faulty gynoid leaves Batou a cryptic message, he begins to question the cause of their malfunctions. Suspicions of politically motivated murder and an illegal "ghost" quickly crop up, drawing Batou and his partner Togusa into a perilous web of conspiracy.
