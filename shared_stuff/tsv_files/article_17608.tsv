Jigokuraku	TV	None	None	None	None	None	None	4864	13126	Gabimaru the Hollow, a ninja of Iwagakure Village known for being cold and emotionless, was set up by his fellow ninja and is now on death row. Tired of killing and betrayal, he wants to die. However, no method of execution works on him because as much as the seemingly apathetic Gabimaru refuses to admit it, he does have a reason to live. He wants to return to his wife, who was the reason why he softened up and failed to be an effective assassin. Thus, he refuses to die.	['Jigokuraku']	[]	[]	[['Kaku, Yuuji', ['Original Creator']]]
