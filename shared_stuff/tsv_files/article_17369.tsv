Shikkakumon no Saikyou Kenja	TV	None	2022-01-01 00:00:00	None	None	None	None	4878	14508	In a world of magic, the powers and future of a mage are predetermined at birth through so-called "Marks"â€”four symbols that categorize a human's aptitude for magic. Lamenting the fact that his mark was considered ill-suited for combat and only useful for magic augmentation, an incredibly skilled sage decided to reincarnate thousands years in the future.
