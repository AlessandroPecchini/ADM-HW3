Ga no Iru Tokoro (A Place Where There Are Moths)	Movie	1	2001-01-01 00:00:00	None	4.36	484	11888	11373	913	A Place Where There Are Moths depicts the conflict between drab concrete block apartment living and the natural environment in Japanese cities. The forces of nature are represented by the motif of a tree whose leaves metamorphose into orange moths and take over a middle-aged woman's apartment, pushing her room higher and higher within the building.
