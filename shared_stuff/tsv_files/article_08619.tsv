It is the wish Cestvs' owner has promised to grant him, but only after he wins 100 battles. However, Cestvs quickly comes to terms with the fact that, as a slave, his life is expendable. After the death of his friend, the possibility of freedom is the only thing keeping him going. With a burning ambition to attain it, Cestvs embarks on a journey to earn himself back, even if it means fighting other slaves for the entertainment of the public.
