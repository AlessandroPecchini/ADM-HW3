Android Ana Maico 2010 (Android Announcer Maico 2010)	TV	24	1998-04-06 00:00:00	1998-09-28 00:00:00	6.42	924	6551	8294	3102	In the year 2010, the Japanese radio industry is in decline. To reverse their flagging ratings, a station staffed with perennial losers makes a daring gamble: to hire the industry's first android on-air host. Maico is cute, but it will take more than novelty to win over the fickle audience -- especially with a crew as inept as this one.
