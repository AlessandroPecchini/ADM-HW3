Terra e... (Toward the Terra)	Movie	1	1980-04-26 00:00:00	None	6.45	3069	6392	5504	9124	In the five hundred years since Earth's environment was destroyed and the planet came to be known as Terra, humans have created a society in space that is entirely logical. Supercomputers control the government, babies are grown in artificial wombs and assigned parents randomly, and at age 14, children take an "Adulthood Exam." Humanity's greatest enemy is the "Mu"â€”humans who have developed into espers.	['Terra e...
