Usavich Special	Special	1	2008-10-31 00:00:00	None	6.41	1044	6618	9652	1841	Usavich (ウサビッチ) (from Japanese うさぎ "usagi", rabbit, with "vich" giving it faux Russian flavor) is a series of animated short films being produced for MTV Japan by Kanaban Graphics. It's about an odd couple of rabbits imprisoned in a Russian prison. While the first season (1-13 eps) shows the absurd everyday occurrences of the two rabbits' prison life, the second season (14-26 eps) tells the adventures of their escape and life on the run.
