Detective Conan Movie 11: Jolly Roger in the Deep Azure	Movie	1	2007-04-21 00:00:00	None	7.45	22054	1796	2912	37583	The luscious hills of Koumi Island are one of many reasons tourists pay its shores a visitâ€”a reason that comes second only to its scenic coral reefs and the legend of Anne Bonnie and Mary Read. The museum that houses the cutlass and pistol of the daring pirate duo does wonders for the small island's tourism.
