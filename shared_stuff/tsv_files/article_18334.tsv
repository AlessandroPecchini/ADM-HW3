During this time period, the Miroku have been the harbingers and guardians of a terrifying power—control over a group of sex demons known as the Shikima. This power lies in the form of a magical, light-emanating compact which was given to the Miroku clan. Anyone who bathes in the compact's light will be held victim to the Shikima's perverted assaults.
