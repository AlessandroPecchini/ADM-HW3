Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi (Kakuriyo: Bed and Breakfast for Spirits)	TV	26	2018-04-02 00:00:00	2018-09-24 00:00:00	7.51	41645	1609	1372	125076	Abandoned as a child by her mother, Aoi Tsubaki has always had the ability to see "ayakashi"â€”spirits from the Hidden Realm. Shirou Tsubaki, her grandfather who shared the same ability, took her under his wing and taught her how to live with the ayakashi in peace. When her grandfather abruptly passes away, the independent Aoi must continue her college career, armed with only her knowledge in cooking as a means of protection against the human-eating spirits. In hopes that the ayakashi will not turn to her or other unknowing humans as a tasty meal, she takes it upon herself to feed the hungry creatures that cross her path.
