Mononoke	TV	12	2007-07-13 00:00:00	2007-09-28 00:00:00	8.44	69906	138	687	258504	The "Medicine Seller" is a deadly and mysterious master of the occult who travels across feudal Japan in search of malevolent spirits called "mononoke" to slay. When he locates one of these spirits, he cannot simply kill it; he must first learn its Form, its Truth, and its Reason in order to wield the mighty Exorcism Sword and fight against it. He must begin  his strange exorcisms with intense psychological analysis and careful investigative workâ€”an extremely dangerous step, as he must first confront and learn about the mononoke before he even has the means to defeat it.
