Now 17 years old and the boss of his own gang, Ash begins investigating the mysterious "Banana Fish"â€”the same two words his older brother, Griffin, has muttered since his return from the Iraq War. However, his inquiries are hindered when Dino sends his men after Ash at an underground bar he uses as a hideout.
