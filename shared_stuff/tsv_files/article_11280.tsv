Ao Oni The Animation (Aooni The Blue Monster)	TV	13	2016-10-03 00:00:00	2017-01-09 00:00:00	5.11	8731	11285	4164	18349	In most ordinary high schools, many stories and rumors float aroundâ€”some scandalous, some happy and some...more macabre. One such example is of monsters lurking in an abandoned mansion outside of town. Such tales, however, prove too tempting to resist for Hiroshi and his friends Mika, Takeshi, and Takurou. They decide to brave the rumored dangers in order to investigate the manor and complete a test of courage. Each of them approaches the mansion with an overwhelming sense of dread. And when they enter, they come upon a blue monster named Ao Oni who attacks them.
