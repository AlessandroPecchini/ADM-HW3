The story revolves around the three main Zoobles: Chevy, a Cat Zooble with an Orange Flavour; Coron, a Rabbit Zooble with a Strawberry Milk Flavour; and Panky, a Panda Zooble with a Blueberry Yogurt Flavour. The three of them live in Candy Town, and they get into serious misadventures as they try to get in (and out of) trouble.
