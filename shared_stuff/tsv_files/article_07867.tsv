In recent years, however, the show has fallen off the radar and it is now mostly forgotten. In an attempt to save the show from being canceled, this young woman desperately tries to look for a unique topic to use as inspiration. She finds it in the form of "Evol," a mysterious gene that has granted certain people special powers and is considered the next step in human evolution.
