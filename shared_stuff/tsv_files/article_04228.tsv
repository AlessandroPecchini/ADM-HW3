Sumomomo Momomo: Chijou Saikyou no Yome	TV	22	2006-10-06 00:00:00	2007-03-16 00:00:00	6.89	20985	4231	2289	58357	Koushi Inuzuka is a smart high school student who aims to become a public prosecutor. Unfortunately for our good guy, he was born into a martial arts family whose head (ie his father) only knows one language: violence. When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend's daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth's strongest martial arts clan.
