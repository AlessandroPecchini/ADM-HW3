Garo: Guren no Tsuki (Garo: Crimson Moon)	TV	23	2015-10-10 00:00:00	2016-04-02 00:00:00	5.9	7116	9022	3401	28219	Monsters known as "Horrors" have invaded the world, entering through gates from the Makai Realm of Darkness. These corrupt, demonic creatures have the ability to seize human bodies and feed on their souls. Citizens who are out past sunset will likely never see the sun rise again, but those who live in the capital city have no need to worryâ€”they are protected by a spiritual force field created by the sorcerer group Onmyouji.
