Kiss made, Ato 1 Byou. (A Second Away From A Kiss)	ONA	30	2018-08-10 00:00:00	2018-09-07 00:00:00	None	None	16777	11644	826	He said he'd stop one second before we kiss... So why are we really kissing right now!? My first kiss is on stage performing a play......! We've been friends since we were kids, and Izuru's always bossing me around. I have to write the script for our school festival play, which is a relief because at least I can steer clear of Izuru, who's playing the leading role of the prince...... But on performance day, the princess gets sick, and I have to take her place! I'm dreading the final kissing scene. We're just supposed to pretend, but now... our lips are... touching...! I know it's Izuru... but he looks like a handsome prince, and... he's actually kinda hot......	['Kiss made, Ato 1-byou.']	[]	[]	[]
