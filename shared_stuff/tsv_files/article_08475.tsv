Keishichou Tokumubu Tokushu Kyouakuhan Taisakushitsu Dainanaka: Tokunana	TV	12	2019-10-06 00:00:00	2019-12-29 00:00:00	6.04	11855	8479	2763	41348	In Tokyo, there exists a peaceful cohabitation between supernatural creatures—elves, dwarves, vampires, and more—and humans. However, contrary to history, powerful dragons once ruled over this world of creatures and humans but have since disappeared. Consequently, a diabolical group under the alias "Nine," who seek the miracles of the once godlike dragons, stirs up trouble in the streets of Tokyo, commiting mass murder and causing destruction. To combat the dangerous group of Nine, the police organize the Special 7—a group of highly skilled professionals whose abilities exceed those of ordinary humans.
