Manga Nippon Mukashibanashi (1976)	TV	1471	1976-01-07 00:00:00	1994-09-03 00:00:00	6.1	316	8172	10608	1240	An omnibus-format TV series consisting of anime adaptations of Japanese folk tales, this is one of Japan's longest-running TV series, and Group Tac's second TV series (the first was The Road to Munich, a documentary anime about the 1972 Olympics). The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation's Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful.
