(Drawer Hobbs)	Movie	1	2011-03-05 00:00:00	None	6.78	3238	4726	6808	5356	Noel Hiiragi thinks that her life is stressful enough living alone and working at a call center when her mother sends her a six-drawer wardrobe out of the blue. In hopes of returning the furniture after attempting to stuff it in a corner of her tiny apartment, she calls her mother to complain about the sudden burden, but her mom only vaguely tells Noel that it is "her turn."
