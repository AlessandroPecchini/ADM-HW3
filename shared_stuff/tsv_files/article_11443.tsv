Norakuro Nitouhei: Kyouren no Maki	Movie	1	1933-06-14 00:00:00	None	5.01	437	11448	11472	873	The Company and Regimental Commanders engage in an idle chit-chat, blithely ignorant of the troops forging ahead under the previous "Forward March" command. Norakuro and his fellow recruits march gamely forward, regardless of the obstacles that may lie in their way. However, a horse stable looms up ahead.
