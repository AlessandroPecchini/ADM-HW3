It follows three girls; a monkey, a pheasant, a dog--all companion animals in the folktale Momotarou. Other folktale characters make appearances but the main episode progression is the girls doing things in the city while non-stop chatting about things happening in the city. This shows off efficient public transportation, volunteer work to help others such as blood donation, countryside landscapes that are friendly for the elderly, fun sporting events, etc.	None	[]	[]	[]
