Bleach Movie 1: Memories of Nobody	Movie	1	2006-12-16 00:00:00	None	7.44	150750	1816	744	239313	When a life ends, its soul departs to its final resting place known as the Soul Society. However, if a soul is left to wander in the human world for too long, it ends up turning into a corrupted "Hollow" that feeds on other souls. In such cases, spirits called "Soul Reapers" are needed to eliminate the Hollows and guide the lost souls to the Soul Society.
