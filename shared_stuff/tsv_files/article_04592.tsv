A divine space being punishes Golion for his arrogance and abuse by seperating him into 5 different lion robots.

After encountering the alien race known as the Galra, the 5 youths end up on the planet Altea, and learn that the 5 lion robots that Golion was split into are in hibernation in various parts of Altea.
