Any soul unfortunate enough to be imprisoned here is sure to be terrified by the horrors within. However, the human princess Aurora Suya Rhys "Syalis" Kaymin is a different case. Rather indifferent to her situation, Syalis worries about one thing and one thing onlyâ€”sleep. Ever since the demon lord kidnapped her from her kingdom, she has not had a single good night's rest.
