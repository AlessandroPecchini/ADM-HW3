Ometeotl Hero	Movie	1	2020-03-14 00:00:00	None	None	None	12561	13005	495	In the year 22XX, due to the drastic decrease in the human population, the government starts accepting races from other allied planets. As a result of genetic mixing, new species are born with special powers. A young man named Yuuki learns on his 18th birthday that while his father is a member of the "hero" tribe, his mother is a member of a tribe of beings who can manipulate plants who were supposedly wiped out due to the accelerated mechanization of the planet. As a result, Yuuki holds powers of both tribes, but he questions which side he should help with his powers.	['Michiru Rescue!', 'Rebecca']	[]	[]	[['Awazu, Jun', ['Director']]]
