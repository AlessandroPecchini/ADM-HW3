Urusei Yatsura	TV	195	1981-10-14 00:00:00	1986-03-19 00:00:00	7.69	9808	1081	2167	64762	Not much is notable about the lecherous Ataru Moroboshi, but his extraordinary bad luck sticks out like the horns in an alien's head. When Earth is threatened by a fleet of alien invaders known as the Oni, Ataru is selected to represent humanity in a duel against one of them. It's a stroke of rare luck for Ataru that the duel is in fact a game of tag, and that his opponent is Lum, daughter of the Oni's leader, who places her personal dignity above victoryâ€”as Ataru finds out by seizing Lum's bikini top and with it, victory.
