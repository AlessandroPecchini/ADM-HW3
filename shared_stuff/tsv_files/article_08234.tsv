Dr.	Music	1	2009-03-14 00:00:00	None	6.09	1212	8237	8897	2459	The video's story is set in the year 3000 on an Earth that has been reduced to ruins by weapons of mass destruction and environmental destruction. An animated alter-ego of Amuro is the lone survivor who wants to restore the once beautiful planet. She attempts to "convey a message of 'world peace' that transcends time" to the 21st century through a time-slip. A girl living in the present (as represented by another alter-ego of Amuro) receives that message of world peace.
