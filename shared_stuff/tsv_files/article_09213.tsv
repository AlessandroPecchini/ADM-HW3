Himitsukessha Taka no Tsume Gaiden: Mukashi no Yoshida-kun	TV	9	2012-01-22 00:00:00	2012-03-18 00:00:00	5.85	114	9217	13373	430	The television shorts follow the original anime's Yoshida-kun character as he travels through western Japan's Shimane Prefecture, his birthplace, in the past. The opening season starts out with a modern Yoshida-kun looking at a photo album with Chancellor as the former recounts his youth including how he and Phillip met (as they were best friends before the start of the franchise and why Phillip so easily joined the organization). Each episode of the Shimane sightseeing guide program introduce one famous place in the prefecture. The anime concludes back in current time with the Chancellor completely shocked at Yoshida-kun's story.	['Yoshida no Matsue Beauty Daisakusen', 'Matsue Kankou Taishi Sanri ga Iku!
