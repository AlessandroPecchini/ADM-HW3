Oshiete! Galko-chan (Please tell me! Galko-chan)	TV	12	2016-01-08 00:00:00	2016-03-25 00:00:00	7.08	67391	3435	1140	156756	At first glance, Galko, Otako, and Ojou are three high school girls who seem like they wouldn’t have anything to do with each other. Galko is a social butterfly with a reputation for being a party animal, even though she is actually innocent and good-hearted despite her appearance. Otako is a plain-looking girl with a sarcastic personality and a rabid love of manga. And Ojou is a wealthy young lady with excellent social graces, though she can be a bit absent-minded at times. Despite their differences, the three are best friends, and together they love to talk about various myths and ask candid questions about the female body.	['Oshiete!
