Quanzhi Gaoshou 2 (The King's Avatar 2)	ONA	12	2020-09-25 00:00:00	2020-12-04 00:00:00	7.98	28312	583	1725	92426	The "Unspecialized" character Lord Grim is infamous in the 10th server of the popular online game Glory. His reputation alone is enough to draw many curious players to his newly formed Guild Happy. Other competing guilds have enough to worry about with some of their own members abandoning them for Happy. However, they are also concerned by rumors that the person behind Lord Grim is really the retired professional gamer and "Glory Textbook" Ye Qiu, whom they have little chance of opposing.
