Vivi	Music	1	2012-03-15 00:00:00	None	5.98	418	8761	11959	737	A song from a concept album about an imaginary town that is built on top of a catfish. All of the songs are stories that happen in the town. The idea of having a miniature town was one of Yonezu's first when planning the album, and he created characters and stories for the people who lived in the town. Yonezu considers the lyrics of "vivi" to be the closest to his own feelings.	['Koi to Byounetsu']	[]	[]	[['Yonezu, Kenshi', ['Director', ' Music']]]
