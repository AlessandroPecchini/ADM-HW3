Though the two siblings can only depend on each other, Shi Miao's violent tendencies combined with Shi Fen's knack for causing trouble cause them to fight constantly. And so, Shi Miao can only hope that someone might take her brother awayâ€”even though, when push comes to shove, Shi Fen always tries to do what he believes is best for his cute younger sister.
