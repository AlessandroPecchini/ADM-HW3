Jigoku Shoujo: Yoi no Togi (Hell Girl: Fourth Twilight)	TV	6	2017-07-15 00:00:00	2017-08-19 00:00:00	6.57	15481	5775	2492	50301	If you have a grudge against someone, you can access the Hell Correspondence website at the stroke of midnight, type in your grudge's name, and the Hell Girl, Ai Enma, will appear to grant your wish. However, the price for ridding yourself of such a burden is a steep one: in return for condemning the soul of your tormentor to Hell, your soul will also face eternal damnation. In her long vigil as the Hell Girl, Ai has met many willing to pay such a cost.
