Chiyu Mahou no Machigatta Tsukaikata: Senjou wo Kakeru Kaifuku Youin	Unknown	None	None	None	None	None	None	9820	1889	Ken Usato is a normal high-schooler in every sense of the word—average grades, dreams, and a tendency to dislike extraordinary people. However, when he encounters the president and the vice president of the student council, both popular and extraordinary, he immediately befriends them. All of this is interrupted when Ken's new friends are summoned into another world—and he accidentally gets summoned as well!
