Fairy Tail Movie 1: Houou no Miko	Movie	1	2012-08-18 00:00:00	None	7.38	105769	2032	966	185735	In the mountains of north Fiore lies the Fire Village, where a lush-blue relic known as the Phoenix Stone is preserved. Entrusted to a mystifying woman named Éclair, it is said to contain the power of an ancient phoenix. She wanders the land alone and protects the stone from harm, despite having no memory of why it was left in her care and only the faintest recollection of where she must take it.
