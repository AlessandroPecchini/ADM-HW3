Tenshi no 3P! (Angel's 3Piece!)	TV	12	2017-07-10 00:00:00	2017-09-25 00:00:00	6.63	18884	5440	2390	55034	Since entering high school, Kyou Nukui has not attended a single class. Instead, he spends his days locked in his bedroom composing music and posting it on the internet accompanied by his only friend's drawings, an artist with the pseudonym "Kiriyume." One day, Kyou hesitantly uploads his newest composition, and first departure from his typical style, TR03. Additionally, he does not upload under his usual handle "HibikiP," but simply under the name "me," and without a drawing from his mysterious friend.
