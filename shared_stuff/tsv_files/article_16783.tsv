KiyaKiya	Music	1	2011-01-01 00:00:00	None	None	None	16790	15537	232	The term "KiyaKiya" comes from the old Japanese expression "mune ga kiyakiya suru." I first encountered it in Shibusawa Tatsuhiko's book Introductory Essays on Girls, in the chapter about "childhood experiences." The expression, which describes “an enigmatic, nostalgic, disturbing feeling,” or an impression of “deja-vu”, is at the origin of my "KiyaKiya" series.
