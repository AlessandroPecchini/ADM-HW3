Isobe Isobee Monogatari: Ukiyo wa Tsurai yo	ONA	5	2013-12-19 00:00:00	2014-04-03 00:00:00	None	None	16333	14034	349	In this ukiyoe-style flash anime, Isobe Isobee is a lazy, slacker samurai with big dreams. He lives with his mother, who thinks highly of him. He lays around the house, sneakily looks at Edo-period pornography without his mother noticing, naps at school, but he plans to become a respectable samurai one day!
