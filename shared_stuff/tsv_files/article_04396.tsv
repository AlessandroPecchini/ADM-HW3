Taimadou Gakuen 35 Shiken Shoutai	TV	12	2015-10-08 00:00:00	2015-12-24 00:00:00	6.85	126515	4398	659	268158	In a world plagued by magical dangers and threats, there exist special warriors—known as Inquisitors—who are tasked with non-violently preventing these threats and nefarious actions. The Anti-Magic Academy is a specialized school built to educate and train these Inquisitors, which splits its students into small squads in order to train them to work together. Among these talented squads is the 35th Test Platoon, also known as the "Small Fry Platoon" due to its low ranking and incompetent members.
