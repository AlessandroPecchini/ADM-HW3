Karma	Movie	1	1977-01-01 00:00:00	None	5.13	181	11254	13631	403	"In his early experimental short Karma (カルマ, 1977), Aihara uses water as his central motif.  The film is hand drawn and appears to be shot on 16mm using a blue filter.  At first we can only see tiny specks on the screen, coming and going like snow flurries.  The specks gradually grow larger and take the shape of bubbles, then even larger into rivulets of water on a transparent surface."	None	[]	[]	[['Aihara, Nobuhiro', ['Director']]]
