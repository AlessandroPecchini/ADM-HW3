Following this development, the Soviet Security Force (SSF) was formed to establish humanity's presence throughout the galaxy. Among the SSF's many divisions is the Special Armored Company (SAC) #101. Using powerful mobile humanoid weapons called "Armored Knights," these female enforcers dispense justice upon corrupt officials, crime lords, and other villainous forces threatening public order.
