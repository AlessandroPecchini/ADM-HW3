Tsuki ga Michibiku Isekai Douchuu (Tsukimichi -Moonlit Fantasy-)	TV	12	2021-07-07 00:00:00	2021-09-22 00:00:00	7.75	92749	947	888	201906	As part of a mysterious contract agreed upon by a goddess and his parents years ago, Makoto Misumi finds himself sent to another world to meet the goddess and become the hero. However, the deity deems Makoto to be "hideous," refusing to even lay eyes upon him and revokes his heroic title. Disdainfully giving him the ability to understand all languages except the human language as compensation, the goddess drives Makoto off to the farthest edges of the wasteland, far from human civilization.
