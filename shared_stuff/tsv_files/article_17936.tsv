Heartful Maman The Animation	OVA	1	2017-10-27 00:00:00	None	6.75	3534	None	5825	8004	Mao-kun is an ordinary high schooler-looking guy to the naked eye. What isn't ordinary in him though, is his family. His mother died when he was little, and his dad raised him alone since then. Because of the lack of motherly love, Mao-kun slowly became scared of women, also known as gynophobia. Suddenly, his dad remarries and give the new mother permission to fulfill Mao-kun's desire of motherly loveâ€”maybe a bit too much love.
