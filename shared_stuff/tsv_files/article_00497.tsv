Forced to escape only with Son Hak, who is both her childhood friend and bodyguard, the na√Øve princess soon discovers that Kouka is not the idyllic place she envisioned it to be. Poverty, strife, and corruption run rampant, making reclaiming the throne nothing more than a wishful fantasy given the kingdom's current state.
