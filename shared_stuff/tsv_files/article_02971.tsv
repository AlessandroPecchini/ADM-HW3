Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau (Children of the Whales)	TV	12	2017-10-08 00:00:00	2017-12-24 00:00:00	7.18	84811	2973	941	192824	In a world covered by an endless sea of sand, there sails an island known as the Mud Whale. In its interior lies an ancient town, where the majority of its inhabitants are said to be "Marked," a double-edged trait that grants them supernatural abilities at the cost of an untimely death. Chakuro is the village archivist; young and curious, he spends his time documenting the discovery of newfound islands. But each one is like the restâ€”abandoned save for the remnants of those who lived there long ago.
