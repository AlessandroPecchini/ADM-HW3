Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn - Prologue	ONA	1	2019-02-17 00:00:00	None	6.6	3487	5590	5687	8498	In an age when gods walk alongside mankind, the world of Eos finds itself falling into darkness. Calamity befalls the human race when malevolent creatures known as "daemons" scourge the land and obliterate armies with seemingly unstoppable brute force. In these dire times, nobles of House Caelum rise to prominence. Owing to their god-given healing powers, which allow them to purge the plague spread by the monsters, they earn the people's trust and allegiance.
