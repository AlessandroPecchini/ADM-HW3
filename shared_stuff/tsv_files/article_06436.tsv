But now all that seems like a distant memory. He has become fat, lazy, unemployed, and altogether unlovable. In the real world, people are grossed out by him. He has never had a girlfriend and he spends his late nights fantasizing about women whose pictures he leers at on the internet. His own life appalls him, but he has one escape â€“ his online life. Gaming has become his everything, and he excels at it.	None	['Ah Reum, Jeong', 'Min, Seong', 'Woo, Sang', 'Mi, Sae', 'Jeong, Min']	[]	[]
