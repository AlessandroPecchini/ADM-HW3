Terra Formars (Terraformars)	TV	13	2014-09-27 00:00:00	2014-12-20 00:00:00	7.02	100233	3744	876	203968	During the 21st century, humanity attempted to colonize Mars by sending two species which could endure the harsh environment of the planet to terraform itâ€”algae and cockroaches. However, they did not anticipate the species' remarkable ability to adapt. Now in the 26th century, a lethal disease known as the Alien Engine Virus has arrived on Earth, and the cure is suspected to be found only on Mars. The problem is, Mars in the present is overrun by creatures known as "Terraformars," incredibly powerful and intelligent humanoid cockroaches that mutated from those originally sent to the planet.
