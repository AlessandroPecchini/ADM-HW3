Each day, Ishida would paint on the wall and photograph it using the available light from the window. The 7-minute long film, which is accompanied by haunting organ music composed by J.S. Bach, consists of those several seconds of film Ishida shot daily.	['Kangaeru Renshuu', 'Kaidan', 'Ga no Iru Tokoro']	[]	[]	[['Ishida, Takashi', ['Director']]]
