Makai Senki Disgaea: Welcome to Netherworld	Special	1	2006-02-23 00:00:00	None	6.73	1814	4986	7247	4597	A unique trailer found on both the DVDs and on the Disgaea 2 game advertising the anime. The animation for it is completely new, none is recycled from the show itself. Does a decent job of introducing the major characters and general plot, with new battle scenes and an altered plot so as to not give everything away. There's even a boom in shot at one point!
