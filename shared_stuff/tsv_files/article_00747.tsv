His birth creates a radiant surge throughout the rukh, a declaration of a singularity to those who stand at the pinnacle of magical might: the "Child of Destiny" is here. Despite his country being plagued by economic instability and the repercussions of war, Sinbad leads a cheerful lifeâ€”until a stranger's arrival shatters his peaceful world, and tragedy soon befalls him.
