My Shelter	Movie	1	1981-10-01 00:00:00	None	None	None	12234	18471	37	Following on from SHELTER, the setting is again an air-raid shelter. Close-up images of trees are dissected and reformed abstractly. The film culminates with images of elderly survivors of the war in another example of Aiharaâ€™s unique blending of documentary storytelling with abstract illustration.
