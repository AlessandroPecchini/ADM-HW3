Push	Special	1	1987-08-21 00:00:00	None	6.25	1198	7421	9470	1979	In a convenient world where vending machines offer just about everything, the hero procures whatever he needs from machines on his journey to see the creator. He tries to make a replacement purchase of the earth. But the creator declines his request, saying simply that there is no such thing as a brand new earth. The simplicity of the story illustrates the depths of Tezuka Osamu's despair at earths degradation, forming the gist of this 4 minute work. 	None	[]	[]	[['Tezuka, Osamu', ['Original Creator']]]
