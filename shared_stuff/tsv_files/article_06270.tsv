Seikoku no Dragonar (Dragonar Academy)	TV	12	2014-04-05 00:00:00	2014-06-21 00:00:00	6.47	92490	6273	951	188688	Learning to ride and tame dragons comes easy to most students at Ansarivan Dragonar Academyâ€”except for first-year student Ash Blake, who is known by his fellow classmates as the "number one problem child." Poor Ash is the laughing stock at school because, despite his unfashionably large star-shaped brand that marks him as a future dragon master, he has nothing to show for it. His dragon has never appeared.
