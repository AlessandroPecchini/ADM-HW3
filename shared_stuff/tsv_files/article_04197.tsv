Naruto Movie 3: Dai Koufun! Mikazuki Jima no Animaru Panikku Dattebayo!	Movie	1	2006-08-05 00:00:00	None	6.9	103863	4200	1004	175386	Led by Kakashi Hatake, Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, and Rock Lee are tasked to escort the extravagant Prince Michiru Tsuki and his spoiled son Hikaru to the prosperous Land of Moon when the two return from a long trip around the world. As if guarding two whimsical high-ranked individuals was not challenging enough, the prince's reckless decision to acquire an entire circus during their journey—mainly to entertain Hikaru's wish of owning the saber-toothed tiger featured in the show—further propels the mission into disarray.
