Tang Lang Bu Chan (The Praying Mantis)	Movie	1	1988-01-01 00:00:00	None	5.7	220	9762	13286	444	A cicada is resting high on a tree. It is chirping for all itâ€™s worth and drinking in the dew, oblivious of a mantis behind. The mantis, bending over and arching up its front leg, is going to catch the cicada but does not know that there is an oriole beside it. The bird has stretched out its neck, ready to peck at the mantis. Again the oriole is unaware that a weasel is sneaking up to it. The three creatures all covet gains ahead without being aware of an imminent danger behind. 	None	[]	[]	[]
