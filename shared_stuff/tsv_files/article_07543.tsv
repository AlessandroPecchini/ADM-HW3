Buttobi!! CPU (I Dream of Mimi)	OVA	3	1997-04-25 00:00:00	1997-09-26 00:00:00	6.23	3154	7548	5921	7603	Embarrassed to be the only member of the Electric Brain Study Society who doesnâ€™t own a computer, Akira Takaoka is thrilled when an electronics store advertises a PC9821 for only ninety-eight thousand yen. The deal is limited to the first five customers; unfortunately, by the time Akira gets there, the PCs are sold out. However, a mysterious man in the back alley offers him the exact same deal. Akira takes the deal, only to realize that this PC is not a 9821 version, but a 2198 version instead. It turns out that the PC2198 is an advanced bio-type computer that needs a nearly constant input of sperm to function!	['Buttobi!!
