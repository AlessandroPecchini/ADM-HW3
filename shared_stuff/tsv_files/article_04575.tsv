Yuu☆Yuu☆Hakusho (Movie) (Yu Yu Hakusho: The Movie)	Movie	1	1993-07-10 00:00:00	None	6.81	12887	4577	3482	26742	Yusuke Urameshi is not exactly what you'd call an angel. In fact, some might call him down right devilish. But when he dies in an accident trying to save a child, he finds himself in the Spirit World. Unfortunately for Yusuke, his name is not listed in the Book of Enma, which means it was one big mistake! So he should return from the Spirit World, but must pass a few tests first, and become a detective of the spiritual world.
