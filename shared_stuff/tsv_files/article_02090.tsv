Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito 1 - Yokuryuu wa Maiorita	Movie	1	2012-07-16 00:00:00	None	7.37	81529	2094	1090	162470	It is the year 2017, and Europe is being invaded by the forces of the Holy Britannian Empire. In an attempt to combat the opposition's overwhelming pressure and put an end to the massive casualties, the army forms a special unit called Wyvern, or W-0, composed of former Japanese citizens referred to as "Elevens." Recruited from ghettos, these young men and women pilot Knightmare frames—humanoid war machines—into dangerous operations where death awaits, hoping to make a name for themselves.
