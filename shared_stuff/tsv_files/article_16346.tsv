Jam Pot	Movie	1	1971-01-01 00:00:00	None	None	None	16353	17835	94	Described by filmmaker Nobuhiro Kawanaka as ‘sexier than sex itself’, the film intercuts between close-up images of a naked heterosexual couple and long shots of a bamboo forest taken from above using a helicopter. The edited cut was projected and rephotographed using high contrast black-and-white film, which was printed in 80-100 types of color gradations at the laboratory, creating what looked like a posterization effect.
