Ore ga Ojousama Gakkou ni "Shomin Sample" Toshite Gets♥Sareta Ken	TV	12	2015-10-07 00:00:00	2015-12-23 00:00:00	6.75	111043	4847	770	233520	Kimito Kagurazaka is a commoner with a fetish for men's muscles—or at least that's the lie he must keep telling if he wants to keep himself out of trouble at the elite all-girls school, Seikain Academy. Kidnapped by the school under the assumption that he prefers men, Kimito is made to be their "commoner sample," exposing the girls to both commoner and man so that the transition to the world after school is not jarring. Threatened with castration should his sexual preferences not match the school's assumptions, Kimito keeps up the facade to protect his manhood.
