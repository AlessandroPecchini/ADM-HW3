Buggy Map	Special	2	2014-12-09 00:00:00	2015-04-01 00:00:00	4.73	150	11715	15058	265	Short animations by Densuke28 simulating video game bugs. The original short was a personal project and was released on his Vimeo page. The following year, a new version of the work was showcased at a museum exhibition on seven different screens, accompanied with a 3D printed model of the character in the short. A forty-nine second clip titled "BUGGY MAP -Exhibition Ver.-" was uploaded to Densuke28's official Vimeo which combines the animations on the multiple screens into one video.
