Detective Conan Movie 04: Captured in Her Eyes	Movie	1	2000-04-22 00:00:00	None	8.03	31773	517	2435	52866	On a rainy afternoon, the Detective Boys witness a murder across the street. Barred by traffic, the culprit slips away and Conan Edogawa is left a single clue by a dying detective. Days later, another detective is found murdered in a parking lot, leaving the police rattled. Suspicious that the culprit is one of their own, everyone in the police department without an alibi is suspect. But despite being on high alert, they are outmaneuvered and suffer yet another attackâ€”this time with Ran Mouri finding herself in the crossfire.
