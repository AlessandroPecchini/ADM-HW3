Moldiver Ex	OVA	2	1994-01-01 00:00:00	None	None	None	12120	16633	169	The first episode (Go Go! Doll-chan), 12 minutes long, features Mirai working as a rollerskating waitress who encounters the Neophytes in their normal day jobs. At the end we are shown a preview for the 1st Moldiver OVA episode but the text on screen advertises all 6 episodes going on sale. The preview also features a bit of footage that did not make it into the actual final cut of episode 1.	['Moldiver']	[]	[]	[]
