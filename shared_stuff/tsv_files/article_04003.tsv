Ace wo Nerae! 2	OVA	13	1988-07-25 00:00:00	1988-10-25 00:00:00	6.94	738	4006	8987	2362	Three years has passed since the events of the first series. Hiromi continued training with her coach and became Japan's junior champion. Their common profits have also contributed to the coach being chosen as the first trainer of the Japanese Selection of Tennis and is arranged to head a trip with the youngest members of the team to USA. The relation between Hiromi and its trainer is narrower at personal level but it exceeds the teacher-student bond with great difficulty.
