Hustle Punch	TV	26	1965-11-01 00:00:00	1966-04-25 00:00:00	None	None	16242	12963	500	The show centers around three hobos that live in a broken car on top of a junkyard: Punch, Touch, and Boom. Punch is a bear who is literally strong-headed: his head is as hard as a rock, and nothing can knock him down. Boom the weasel is an expert shot, using not a gun, but a slingshot. Touch the mouse takes advantage of her smallness in order to get into small holes and sneaking into things without the villains knowing.
