Hetalia Axis Powers Movie: Paint it, White	Movie	1	2010-06-05 00:00:00	None	7.1	31367	3342	2365	55684	One day, aliens from the planet Pict launch a devastating invasion on Earth. Their sole purpose is to transform all of humanity into "Noppera"â€”featureless creatures with plain white skin, glowing antennae, and no face. This prompts the world's nations to counterattack, but they are all ultimately defeated, as they each launched their offensives separately.
