The Labyrinth has several colonies with severe settings such as one having an insanely high temperature, while another is full of gold and silver. Among those, in a colony of Pinyin, resides a curious nine-year-old girl named Memempu and her father Gagumber. As "workers" aiming for survival, they live with the lowest profession of riding a working robot to dig ore.
