"Bungaku Shoujo" Movie	Movie	1	2010-05-01 00:00:00	None	7.38	25504	2026	2223	61800	The protagonist of the story, Konoha Inoue, is a seemingly normal senior high 2nd year student. His high school life, other than a hinted incident 2 years ago, can be summed up as normal- if one can dismiss the secret fact that he used to be a female bestselling romance author. Due to that incident, however, he has now vowed never to write again.
