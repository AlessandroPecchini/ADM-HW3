He must be careful with his decisions, especially with the ongoing unrest at the borders of Chu and Xinan. However, the matter is taken from his hands when Duan Baiyue—the young Xinan King—puts an end to the rebellion himself. His aid spares Chu Yuan an insurmountable amount of grief, and the people of Chu now hail Duan Baiyue as their hero.	None	['Duan, Baiyue', 'Chu, Yuan']	[]	[]
