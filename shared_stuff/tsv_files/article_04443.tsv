Double Decker! Doug & Kirill	TV	13	2018-09-30 00:00:00	2018-12-23 00:00:00	6.84	10741	4446	3144	33037	The once peaceful city-state of Lisvalletta has found itself beset by a dangerous new drug called Anthem. The side effects of the drug allow the user to enter a state of Overdrive, wherein they mutate into superpowered beasts with inhuman abilities. With the police powerless to stop this new threat, the responsibility falls upon the Special Crime Investigation Unit SEVEN-O. To offset the dangers of this work, the investigators work under the patented "Double Decker" system, which requires them to team up in "buddy cop" pairs.	['Tiger & Bunny', 'Double Decker!
