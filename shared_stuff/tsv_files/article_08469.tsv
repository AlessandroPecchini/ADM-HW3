Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Tokkyuu! Maboroshi no Kisha	Movie	1	1997-07-12 00:00:00	None	6.04	204	8473	11733	797	This film is sort of a mashup of Ghost Train (episode 7) and Great Yokai War (episodes 10-11) from the original 1968 TV series, but with a new spin on it to bring it towards the modernness of the 1996 TV series--essentially making an entirely original plot.
