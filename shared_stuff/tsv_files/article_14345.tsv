Xing You Ji (Rainbow Sea)	TV	26	2011-10-30 00:00:00	None	None	None	14352	12476	612	In an era where everyone is free to travel in space, there still exists an area in the universe where all lives and hopes are forbidden - the black hole. This ruthless star devours anything that comes in close contact, whether it is life, substance, or even light. The most avid adventurers don't dare to even mention going there, because of the risk. Until one day, a man in fiery red clothing declared to the whole universe: "In the deepest part of black hole, lies a mysterious place called Rainbow Sea. A place full of precious stones, rivers of gold and rainbow covered skies. Anyone who gets there gets all their wishes granted." This declaration ignited the enthusiasm of the whole universe, attracting people from everywhere. They followed the man in red into the black hole, and ultimately no one came back. The adventurers that vanished with the man in red were called the descendants of the loathful "Red Devil" and Rainbow Sea was then considered as history's biggest lie ever.
