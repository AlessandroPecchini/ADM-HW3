Jinkou no Rakuen (Artificial Paradise)	Movie	1	1975-01-01 00:00:00	None	4.99	180	11481	13756	377	Psychedelic –and at times sinister– music by Shinpei Kikuchi accompanies a disorienting display of reproduced imagery taken from magazines and posters of sunny beaches and bikini models. Tanaami made positive and negative reprographic prints of these images onto transparent cel sheets, placed them on top of one another, and twisted them in different directions to create a moiré effect. Speaking on the work, Tanaami explained his paradise only exists in the world of reproduction.	None	[]	[]	[['Tanaami, Keiichi', ['Director']]]
