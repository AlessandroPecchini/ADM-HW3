Shiiba-san no Ura no Kao. with Imouto Lip	OVA	1	2014-02-28 00:00:00	None	6.5	1514	None	7515	4191	In a certain normal Japanese high school, there are two peculiar students: a lonesome boy and Shiiba, a mysterious girl. Neither of them have many friends; but unlike the dull and boring boy, Shiiba is beautiful and considered to be in a vastly different league to the other males in school. Therefore, no one has had the courage to ask her out. Nonetheless, it comes as a pleasant surprise to the plain boy when Shiiba invites him to an empty room.
