Naming her in-game character Maple, she sets out on her journey. As a complete novice to such games, she allocates all of her stat points into vitality, desiring to not get hurt. With not a single point in any other stat, Maple has extraordinarily high defense, but she can't move quickly or hit hard.	['Itai no wa Iya nano de Bougyoryoku ni Kyokufuri Shitai to Omoimasu.
