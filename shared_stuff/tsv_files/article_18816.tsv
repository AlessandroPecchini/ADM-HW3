Otenki Oneesan (Weather Report Girl)	OVA	2	1995-06-01 00:00:00	None	5.48	817	None	8894	2460	Hurricane Keiko has arrived! The newscast weather segment. Usually the last thing anyone ever thinks about (unless they said "sun" and it wound up being "rain") but Keiko Nakadai's going to change all that. Toiling in obscurity for years at a horribly rated TV station, Keiko has figured out what the weather report needs and doesn't mind taking off her top (or lifting her skirt) on the air to do it. The ratings aren't going to go down, that's for sure.
