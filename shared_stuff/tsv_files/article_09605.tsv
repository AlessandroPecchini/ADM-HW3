Kikumana	ONA	1	2001-07-14 00:00:00	None	5.74	3990	9610	5845	7854	This work "Kikumana" is an animation of a girl called Kikumana who acts like in a stage performance, the role defeated by such an ill circumstance though she tries to find herself. The primal aim is to get the audience feeling a strange atmosphere spread from this work. The image has a pictorial atmosphere and a documentary touch at the same time. Unrealistic phenomena take place there.	None	[]	[]	[['Yoshiura, Yasuhiro', ['Director']]]
