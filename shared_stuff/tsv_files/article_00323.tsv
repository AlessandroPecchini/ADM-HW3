Girls & Panzer Movie (Girls und Panzer der Film)	Movie	1	2015-11-21 00:00:00	None	8.2	46787	324	1781	88460	Having won the 63rd National Sensha-dou tournament, the girls from Ooarai High managed to prevent their school from closure by the Japanese Ministry of Education. However, new troubles loom on the horizon: a ministry official argues that the deal was not legally binding and that the Ooarai school carrier is to be decommissioned. Students and their families are frustrated with this injustice and overwhelmed with despair; it seems little can be done to save the school.
