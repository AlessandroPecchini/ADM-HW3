Pokemon Fushigi no Dungeon: Toki no Tankentai, Yami no Tankentai	Special	1	2007-09-09 00:00:00	None	6.58	4938	5722	5213	10464	In a world where only Pokémon live, one Hikozaru wishes to be part of Pukurin Guild—a large area where Exploration Teams gather and work. Intimidated by the apparent strength of the guild members and the guild's security, Hikozaru runs away, stumbling over an unconscious Pochama in the middle of his escape. The Pochama wakes up and is immediately shocked by both a talking Hikozaru as well as his own appearance—because Pochama knows that he is actually a human!
