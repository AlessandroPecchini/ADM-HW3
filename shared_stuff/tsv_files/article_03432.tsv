Otsukimi Recital	Music	1	2013-07-02 00:00:00	None	7.08	1779	3436	7573	4100	Hibiya Amamiya has experienced the worst loss possible: the life of a friend. For him, the world no longer holds a glimmer, but high school idol Momo Kisaragi has taken it upon herself to show him that there is a reason to go on. Although sadness clings to Hibiya like the full moon which shines through the night, perhaps Momo will be able to brighten his eyes once again.
