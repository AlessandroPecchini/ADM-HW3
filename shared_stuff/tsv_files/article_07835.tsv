Gegege no Kitarou: Obake Nighter (Spooky Kitaro: The Obake Nighter)	Movie	1	1997-03-08 00:00:00	None	6.17	180	7838	11793	780	Like the other 1990s Kitaro mini-movies, this is a remake of a story that’s already been done in the anime, but like every Kitaro remake this is a very different take on the story. In this case it’s a remake of the baseball story that was featured in the very first episode of the original series from 1968.
