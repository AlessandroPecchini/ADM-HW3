Yamakawa Keiko-san wa Furimukanai	Movie	1	2017-01-01 00:00:00	None	None	None	14410	18303	48	Man often yearns of a past more innocent and pure. This film disregards that sentimentality and depicts a constant, permanent transformation of the landscape of mountains and rivers. A beautiful and intense image poem made from thousands of pencil drawings.	None	[]	[]	[['Kurosaka, Keita', ['Director']]]
