She's on a journey to find the woman Jin Valel, who killed her master Hon without feelingâ€”not unlike how Alka has learned to kill in her work as an assassin. On her journey, Alka encounters three strange women, each a great warrior in her own right and grapples with her slain master's wish that she leaves the life of an assassin behind.
