Hoshi Neko Fullhouse (Star Cat Fullhouse)	OVA	4	1989-06-16 00:00:00	1989-12-25 00:00:00	5.86	238	9166	11226	962	This slapstick comedy is about three pretty girls struggling to earn a living as pilots of the Iron Goblin delivery vessel. The computer answers back, the space pirates are on their tail, and romantic entanglements with their clients cause friction in the trio. The final episode throws the alien Eterna race in to the mix.
