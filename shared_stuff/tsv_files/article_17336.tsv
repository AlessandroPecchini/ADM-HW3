Pluto	Unknown	None	None	None	None	None	None	5793	8213	Based off of a story arc from Osamu Tezuka's Tetsuwan Atom, Pluto follows the Europol detective Gesicht as he tries to uncover the mystery behind a string of robot and human deaths. The case becomes much more puzzling when evidence leans toward the murders being the work of a robot, which is something that hasn't happened for 8 years.
