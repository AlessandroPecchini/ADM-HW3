Hengen Taima Yakou Karura Mau! Nara Onryou Emaki (Karura Mau Movie)	Movie	1	1989-04-08 00:00:00	None	5.77	418	9494	10294	1414	Shoko and Maiko Ougi are apparently two ordinary schoolgirls in pursuit of graduating and having fun. Shii-chan is the more serious while Mai-chan is more fun-loving. In reality, the two sisters are powerful exorcists from the Karura temple. Each wields half the power...Shii-chan can "see" the spirits, and Mai-chan can banish them. This is the movie adaptation of a spooky series with heavy emphasis on traditionally Japanese occult themes. 	['Hengen Taima Yakou Karura Mau!
