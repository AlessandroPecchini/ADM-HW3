Hataraku Saibou!! (Cells at Work!!)	TV	8	2021-01-09 00:00:00	2021-02-27 00:00:00	7.32	59022	2303	852	210273	The cells of the human body never rest for too long; there's always something new to do and learn every day. At least, that's what Hakkekkyuu U-1146 feels as he rushes to and fro, searching for any pathogens that could cause harm to the body. Despite his dangerous line of work, it's all worth it to protect the happy smiles of Sekkekkyuu AE3803, the platelet crew, his fellow neutrophils, and the other cells he meets along the way.
