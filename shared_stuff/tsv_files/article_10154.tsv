Cleopatra (Cleopatra: Queen of Sex)	Movie	1	1970-09-15 00:00:00	None	5.56	1700	10178	7168	4705	In the far future, earthlings come across the foreign planet of Pasatorine. Few things are understood about the planet, but it is clear that earthlings are not welcome there. However, the inhabitants of Pasatorine have initiated something called the "Cleopatra Plan." Puzzled why an alien planet would name a plan after a woman from Earth, the military decides to send three soldiers' minds back to the past to study Cleopatra's life.
