Pia Carrot e Youkoso!!: Sayaka no Koi Monogatari	Movie	1	2002-10-19 00:00:00	None	5.91	1017	8992	8785	2588	High schoolers Sayaka Takai and Akihiko Kannazuki work together at a restaurant chain "Pia Carrot." Both are interested in each other, but before either could make a move Sayaka was temporarily rotated to the newly established branch at a beach resort. While waitress girls at this new location did their best to confront harassment, make new friends, and attract new customers by attending a beauty contest, Sayaka's feeling for Akihiko never stops and has become stronger and stronger.
