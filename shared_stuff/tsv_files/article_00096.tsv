Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 2nd Season Part 2	TV	12	2021-01-06 00:00:00	2021-03-24 00:00:00	8.53	312071	97	243	605274	After a stern yet compelling speech by Otto, Subaru Natsuki solemnly swears that he will successfully make it through this timeline and save everyone he can along the way. The first step toward achieving this goal is to help Emilia work through her past; however, that is easier said than done. Feeling as if she has been lied to by everyone around her, it will be difficult for Emilia to trust anyone, even Subaru, her self-proclaimed knight.
