Tejime	Music	1	2019-04-30 00:00:00	None	5.43	135	10583	15227	251	With a track inspired by Tejime, a Japanese custom of ceremonial rhythmic hand clapping, HIFANA gives thanks and bids farewell to the Heisei era (1989-2019), a time when the transition from analog to digital gave rise to so many new and innovative means of expression. This is their first new song in 9 years.	['24H']	[]	[]	[['Hifana', ['Producer', ' Music']]]
