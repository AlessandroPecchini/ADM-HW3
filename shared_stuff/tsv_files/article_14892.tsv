Awajishima no Shichifukujin (Seven Lucky Gods)	TV	25	2020-10-05 00:00:00	2021-03-05 00:00:00	None	None	14899	17245	135	The story centers on the Seven Gods of Fortune in Japanese mythology as they reside on Awaji Island in Hyogo. In the shorts' story, the Seven Gods of Fortune slack in their duties in heaven, and Susanoo-no-Mikoto banishes them to Awaji Island. In order to return to the heavenly realm, they must help bring happiness to humans and rebuild their virtue. The outcast gods reluctantly grant human wishes and accumulate points in their "god phones" to be able to return to heaven. They aim to perform good deeds on particularly auspicious days to maximize point accumulation. Despite their best efforts at accumulating virtue, sometimes the Seven Gods of Fortune end up bringing misfortune to humans. When they fail, they lose points, further prolonging their stay on Awaji Island.
