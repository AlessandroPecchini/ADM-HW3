Out of retaliation and fear, humanity began focusing at an alternative source of energy: solar power. Different nations have united together to form three major factionsâ€”the Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations, the Advanced European Union, and the Human Reform League. Each of these sectors has access to a solar power generator, which gives them limitless energy.
