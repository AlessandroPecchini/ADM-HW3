Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken	TV	13	2014-10-03 00:00:00	2014-12-26 00:00:00	7.33	161449	2268	561	303801	Though they couldn't be any more different, love has managed to blossom between Hajime Tsunashi, a hardcore otaku who shuts himself in at home while making a living off his blog, and his wife Kaoruâ€”a hard-working office lady who, in contrast, is fairly ordinary, albeit somewhat of a crazy drunk. As this unlikely couple discovers, love is much more than just a first kiss or a wedding; the years that come afterward in the journey of marriage brings with it many joys as well as challenges.
