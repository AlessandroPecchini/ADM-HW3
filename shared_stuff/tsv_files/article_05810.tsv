Mahouka Koukou no Yuutousei (The Honor at Magic High School)	TV	13	2021-07-03 00:00:00	2021-09-25 00:00:00	6.56	19890	5814	1660	97384	It has been a century since "true magic"—initially thought to be merely folklore and legend—had become commonplace technology worldwide. First National Magic University Affiliated High School (First High), one of the nine magic academies in Japan, admits two skilled siblings—Miyuki and Tatsuya Shiba—into the academy. First High splits its students into two groups, Course 1 and Course 2, based on entrance exam scores. This causes an apparent disdain for the Course 2 students, as they are labeled "Weeds" by Course 1 students, who alternatively call themselves "Blooms."
