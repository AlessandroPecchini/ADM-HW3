Santa Company: Manatsu no Merry Christmas	Movie	1	2021-01-28 00:00:00	None	5.46	954	10508	9515	1955	Santa Company is a worldwide organization dedicated to delivering presents to children. Santa Company's elves—known as "tonttus"—aid several Santas every year by wrapping presents, raising reindeer, and helping with deliveries. Mint Rondo is one of the many new tonttus arriving at Santa Company's tropical island office. Following in her older brother's footsteps, Mint begins training alongside her friend, Thomas Dou, and rival, Noah, to eventually become a Santa herself. Unfortunately, her clumsiness causes her to fall far behind her peers and into her brother's shadow.
