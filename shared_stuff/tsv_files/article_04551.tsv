However, a playground accident has since left her afraid of heights, turning her toward indoor hobbies. Unfortunately, now a shy and timid first-year high school student, Aoi has become so absorbed in these pastimes that she can barely socialise with others, leaving her practically friendless. Itâ€™s only when she runs into the lively Hinata Kuraue, an old friend from her climbing days, that things start to change.
