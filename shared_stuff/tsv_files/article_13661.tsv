Taiheiyou ni Kakeru Niji	OVA	1	1992-03-20 00:00:00	None	None	None	13669	15478	234	Schoolgirl Mitsuko tries to protect half-Chinese transfer student Yu-Lian from bullies. That night, she discovers Emily, an old American doll. Given to a Japanese child during an exchange in 1921, it was hidden from the "doll burnings" of the anti-Western war period and saved by a brave young girl (Mitsuko's grandmother). At the next day's show-and-tell, Mitsuko tells the story of Emily and encourages Yu-Lian.	None	[]	[]	[['Yokoyama, Seiji', ['Music']]]
