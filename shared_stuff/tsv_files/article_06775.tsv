Jarinko Chie (TV)	TV	64	1981-10-03 00:00:00	1983-03-25 00:00:00	6.38	140	6778	11319	930	Jarinko Chie is a movie directed by Takahata in 1981. Based on the very popular manga by Etsumi HARUKI, it is about ten year old Chie, "the most unfortunate girl in Japan," who manages her family diner while her unemployed yakuza father and her mother are separated. This sounds really depressing, but it's actually a very funny comedy.
