Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - Tou no Kuni - Free Lance	Special	1	2005-10-19 00:00:00	None	7.59	17368	1354	3054	34538	Waking up from a nap, Kino is relieved to see that a certain tower from afar is still proudly standing. Located in the heart of the Tower Country, the immensely tall tower stretches high into the sky, reaching seemingly infinite heights. The tower looks like something out of a dream, but the breathtaking construction is unmistakably real. Intrigued, the traveling partners Kino and Hermes—the talking motorcycle—journey to the tower to get a closer look at the building.
