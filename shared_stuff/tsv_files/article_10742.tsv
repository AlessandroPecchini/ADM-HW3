Yuki no Taiyou Pilot	Special	1	1972-01-01 00:00:00	None	5.37	1380	10747	8694	2682	This pilot is remembered, really, for one notable reason: this is Miyazaki's first time as a solo director. He teamed up with Takahata for the later episodes of the 1971-72 Lupin III series, but Yuki's Sun marked his first time solely in the captain's seat.
