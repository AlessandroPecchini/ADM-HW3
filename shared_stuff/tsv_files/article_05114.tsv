Ultraman	ONA	13	2019-04-01 00:00:00	None	6.7	9596	5118	3941	20920	Fifty years ago, an extraterrestrial giant of light known as Ultraman saved the earth but vanished. Ultraman's human host, Shin Hayata, was left with no memory of his time as a hero. Hayata's young son, Shinjirou, is found to have been born with a more powerful and durable body than any normal human. The organization who aided Ultraman, the SSSP, reveals Hayata's past to him. His father then dons a power suit again, assuming the role of Ultraman once more.
