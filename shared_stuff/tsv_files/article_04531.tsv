Kuro no Su: Chronus	Movie	1	2014-03-01 00:00:00	None	6.82	8688	4532	4231	17657	For as long as he can remember, Makoto Nakazono has had the power to see grim reapers watching people shortly before their deaths and escorting their souls to heaven. He realized long ago that nobody would believe him if he talked about his ability. Since there is nothing he can do to alter people's fates, he tries his best to pretend that he does not see anything out of the ordinary.
