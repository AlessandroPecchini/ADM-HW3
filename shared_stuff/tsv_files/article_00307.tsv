Yoru wa Mijikashi Arukeyo Otome (Night Is Short, Walk on Girl)	Movie	1	2017-04-07 00:00:00	None	8.21	38084	308	1689	96114	On a mysterious night that seems to last for a year, an ordinary college student continues to chase one of his underclassmen, a girl with black hairâ€”the girl of his dreams. Up until now, he has been relying on a simple plan, which is to calculatingly bump into her every day while making it seem like a meaningful coincidence. However, his efforts remain futile as their relationship is not progressing at all.
