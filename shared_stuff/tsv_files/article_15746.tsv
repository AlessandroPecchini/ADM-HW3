Get Back on the Hill	Movie	1	1974-01-01 00:00:00	None	None	None	15753	17701	106	This film was made based on Tanaamiâ€™s fear of heights and his experience of seeing New York from the rooftop of a 50-floor apartment. Even the quotidian activity of walking across a zebra crossing becomes an abstract image observed from these heights. Using the process of color separation, the colors shift across each frame and create a surreal universe.	None	[]	[]	[['Tanaami, Keiichi', ['Director']]]
