Bokura no Saibanin Monogatari (Our Jury Story)	ONA	1	2009-05-21 00:00:00	None	None	None	15051	13578	399	The Japanese government has commissioned a 22-minute anime video called "Bokura no Saibanin Monogatari" (Our Jury Story) to teach its citizens about the re-introduced jury system. In July, Japan will implement jury trials for the first time in six decades, so most Japanese have never experienced jury duty. The anime uses a high school boy's one-sided infatuation for a classmate as an unusual segue to discuss the jury system. 	['Soumubu Sououka Yamaguchi Roppeita: Saibanin Project Hajimemasu!']	[]	[]	[]
