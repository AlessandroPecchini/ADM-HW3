Batsu & Terry	Movie	1	1987-03-14 00:00:00	None	6.14	120	7965	12606	571	Bats & Terry are the two tough guys in the school. They don't take crap from anyone, not even teachers. They will fight anyone necessary, and will defend strangers (especially pretty girls) from danger. They're good at it too. Some people are in terror of them, and some love them.
