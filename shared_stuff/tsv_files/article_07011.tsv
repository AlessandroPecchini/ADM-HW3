Phantasy Star Online 2 The Animation	TV	12	2016-01-08 00:00:00	2016-04-01 00:00:00	6.33	24596	7015	2206	62939	In the year 2027, the video game Phantasy Star Online 2 is all the rage at Seiga Academy. Every student is on board the fadâ€”except for Itsuki Tachibana, a well-rounded student who doesn't play video games. Due to its popularity, the game is currently under review at Seiga Academy to see if it has a negative impact on the students. Consequently, this causes Itsuki to catch the attention of Rina Izumi, the perfectionist student council president who aims to prove that the game is not to blame.
