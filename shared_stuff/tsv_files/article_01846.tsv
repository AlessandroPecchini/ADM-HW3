The current emperor, Zi Zhou, refuses to bow his head before the gods, and declares to the messenger that he will no longer accept the tyranny of the Heavens. The gods do not take this kindly; and soon, the emperor of a neighboring land, Wu Jifa, leads a crusade against the rebelling Shang.	['Wu Geng Ji Zhi Tianqi', 'Feng Shen Ji']	['Wu, Geng']	[]	[]
