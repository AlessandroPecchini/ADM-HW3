To speed up the operation, we suggest you to work in parallel with your group's colleagues or even generate code that works in parallel with all the CPUs available in your computer. In particular, using the same code, each component of the group can be in charge of downloading a subset of pages (e.g., the first 100). PAY ATTENTION: Once obtained all the pages, merge your results into an unique dataset. In fact, the search engine must look up for results in the whole set of documents.\n",

For this reason, it is extremely important that for every time you crawl a page, you must save it with the name article_i.html, where i corresponds to the number of articles you have already downloaded. In such way, if something goes bad, you can restart your crawling procedure from the i+1-th document."

    "You consult for a personal trainer who has a back-to-back sequence of requests for appointments. A sequence of requests is of the form > 30, 40, 25, 50, 30, 20 where each number is the time that the person who makes the appointment wants to spend. You need to accept some requests, however you need a break between them, so you cannot accept two consecutive requests. For example, [30, 50, 20] is an acceptable solution (of duration 100), but [30, 40, 50, 20] is not, because 30 and 40 are two consecutive appointments. Your goal is to provide to the personal trainer a schedule that maximizes the total length of the accepted appointments. For example, in the previous instance, the optimal solution is [40, 50, 20], of total duration 110.\n",
