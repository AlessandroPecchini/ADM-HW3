To speed up the operation, we suggest you to work in parallel with your group's colleagues or even generate code that works in parallel with all the CPUs available in your computer. In particular, using the same code, each component of the group can be in charge of downloading a subset of pages (e.g., the first 100). PAY ATTENTION: Once obtained all the pages, merge your results into an unique dataset. In fact, the search engine must look up for results in the whole set of documents.\n",

For this reason, it is extremely important that for every time you crawl a page, you must save it with the name article_i.html, where i corresponds to the number of articles you have already downloaded. In such way, if something goes bad, you can restart your crawling procedure from the i+1-th document."
