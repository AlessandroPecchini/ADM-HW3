    "## 5. Algorithmic question\n",
    "You consult for a personal trainer who has a back-to-back sequence of requests for appointments. A sequence of requests is of the form > 30, 40, 25, 50, 30, 20 where each number is the time that the person who makes the appointment wants to spend. You need to accept some requests, however you need a break between them, so you cannot accept two consecutive requests. For example, [30, 50, 20] is an acceptable solution (of duration 100), but [30, 40, 50, 20] is not, because 30 and 40 are two consecutive appointments. Your goal is to provide to the personal trainer a schedule that maximizes the total length of the accepted appointments. For example, in the previous instance, the optimal solution is [40, 50, 20], of total duration 110.\n",

    "* Write an algorithm that computes the acceptable solution with the longest possible duration.\n",
