# ADM-HW3
Repository for the third homework of ADM based on web scraping and querying from an Anime website

In this repository there are 3 directories:

* `code`:
    It's the directory containing all Python scripts, including the Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` (also available on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.org/github/AlessandroPecchini/ADM-HW3/blob/main/code/main.ipynb))

* `shared_stuff`:
    It's a directory containing some (light!!) text and JSON files imported in the notebook
    
* `data`:
    It's an untracked directory containing files too large to be uploaded on GitHub (e.g. the HTML pages we scraped)
